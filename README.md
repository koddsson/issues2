# issues2

A experiment in implementing GitHub Issues in [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/).

I'm not trying to implement everything that GitHub issues offers but focusing on application performance and developer experience.

I've implemented the issues list, issues search and viewing a single issue. The scope of the experiment doesn't go beyond these pages.

The project leverages [Primer ViewComponents](https://primer.style/view-components) in addition to rails to render UI.
